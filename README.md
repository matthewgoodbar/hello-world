# hello-world

Welcome to my github page!

At the moment this is purely for uploading completed school projects and learning how github works, but in the future I hope to contribute to projects regularly.
I program mainly in Java, with a little bit of C and Python as well, and I also dabble in 3D modeling with Blender and game development with Unreal Engine 4.
